    <p class="content">One of the challenges is getting ready for life. Many of us think of learning a language as way to do so. We invest a lot of time to be skillful in speaking, reading, writing and listening to a foreign language because we truly believe it will be a “plus” in our lives. But, how much of a language can you learn in a month?.</p>
    <p class="content">Open the file <a class="icon" href="u5/recursos/learninamonth_u5t3.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="icon libro"></span></a><strong>How much you can learn in a month?</strong> from Oxeden, Clive, &amp; Latham-Koenig Christina. The main context of this text was inspired by an article in the <em>Sunday Times</em> where an experiment was done to see how well someone could learn a foreign language in just a month. When the month was up, the person travelled to the country itself and carried out a series of tasks to see how much he or she had learnt.</p>
    <p class="content">As self-study tasks work on exercises 1a, 1b and 1c, from page 56. Then, revise <b>Modals</b> and check your answers.  That language referent will provide you with information concerning the form, use and meaning of modal verbs to express obligation.</p>
