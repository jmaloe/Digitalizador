    <p class="content">The content of this activity is reading a text based on interviews with people arriving in the UK at Heathrow airport in London. Visitors are questioned about plans and arrangements and each has a story to tell.</p>
    <p class="content">Open the file <strong><a class="icon" href="u5/recursos/wheregoing_u5t1.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="icon libro"></span></a></strong><strong>Where are you going?</strong> from Oxeden, Clive, &amp; Latham-Koenig Christina; and work on the reading exercises 1a, 1b and 1c. These are self-study tasks that will provide preparation for the grammar part of the activity.</p>
   <p class="content">As you finished with reading exercises, look at the interview with Maki and Koji and identify six present continuous sentences. Do they refer to the <b>present</b> or to the <b>future</b>? In order to answer this question, revise the file <strong>Going to</strong>.</p>
   <p class="content">It will help you to understand the form and use of <em>going to</em>, as well as understanding the differences between <em>going to</em> and <em>present continuous</em> for future arrangements.</p>
