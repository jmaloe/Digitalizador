  <p class="content">There is no better way to understand our present than to bring back cities’ history, lifestyle old fashion and trends, sports celebrated moments and families and friends’ memories. Remembering, reading, writing and speaking about past experiences and events is something we probably do many times in a day in our native language. This unit aims at providing you with language exposure and language practice that will help you to communicate past ideas and events in English.</p>
  <p class="content">The materials included in this unit will all make a reference to past tenses in English, such as a famous person’s biography, a description of a well-known American state famous for its valuable historical legacy, and an audio recording of friends reunited. The activities you will be required to carry out will also be diverse. They go from simple self-study exercises to audio recording of your own information. Special attention will also be drawn to grammatical tenses and forms: Simple Past Tense, Present Perfect Tense and <em>Used to</em> form. In addition, vocabulary will be dealt with as you move though the reading texts and audio materials. Dictionary skill will be important for comprehension and production of the language.</p>
  <p class="content">The purpose of the whole unit is to provide students with enough opportunities to activate previous knowledge of English, to revise and learn grammar aspects of the language that are used to refer to the past and to expand vocabulary. Grammar resources have been designed in such a way as to provide students with the clear presentation, guided and free practice, while production tasks need the mastering of key structures. Students will develop listening skills through realistic tasks which reinforce the mastering of the language. Students will develop their speaking skills through a wide range of speaking tasks, enabling students to practice real life communication. </p>
