    <p class="content">Parents of teenagers often complain about their children not tiding things around the house. Even adults find themselves being a little disorganized. What we have not done yet and what we have already done keep our mind busy all day long.</p>
    <p class="content">Open the file <a class="icon" href="u3/recursos/conflicts_u3t2.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="icon libro"></span></a><strong>Family conflicts</strong> from Oxeden, Clive, &amp; Latham-Koenig Christina; as a self-study task. Do exercise 1a and b. Then go to the Grammar section in the same file. Read the conversations, match them with the pictures and find <em>just</em>, <em>yet</em> and <em>already</em> examples in the conversations. What tense is the verb with them? What do you think they mean?.</p>
    <p class="content">Now, study the information in the <strong>Present Perfect + yet, just, already</strong>. It will help you understand this tense as well as their meaning and use.</p>
