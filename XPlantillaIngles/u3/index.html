       <p class="content">Most of what we talk and write comes from our everyday experiences. Conversations topics are about money, family, fears, success and changes issues we deal with as part of our life. Knowing how to speak, read and write about that in English is part of learning the language and being able to communicate in it.</p>
   <p class="content">This unit aims at providing you with language exposure and language practice that will help you to communicate ideas and events that began in the past and continue in the present. The materials included in this unit will all make a reference to Present Perfect and Present Perfect Continuous tenses in English.</p>
   <p class="content">The activities you will be required to carry out will also be diverse. They go from simple self-study exercises to audio recording of your own information. Special attention will also be drawn to grammatical tenses and forms:<em> Present Perfect</em> vs. <em>Simple Past tense</em>. In addition, vocabulary will be dealt with as you move though the reading texts and audio materials.</p>
   <p class="content">The purpose of the whole unit is to provide students with enough opportunities to activate previous knowledge of English, to revise and learn grammar aspects of the language that are used to refer to present and past. Grammar resources have been designed in such a way as to provide students with a clear presentation, guided and free practice, while production tasks need the mastering of key structures. Students will develop listening skills through realistic tasks which reinforce the mastering of the language.</p>
