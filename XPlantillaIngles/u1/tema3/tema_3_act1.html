<article class="ar-title">Learning activity 1</article>
<p class="content">The topic of this activity is food; it looks at different attitudes to food around the world.</p>
<p class="content">What kind of food do people associate with your country? What do you normally eat in a typical day? How often do you eat out a week? These and other questions are part of the text <strong><a class="icon" href="u1/recursos/food_u1t3.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="icon libro"></span></a>Food: fuel of pleasure?</strong> from Oxeden, Clive, &amp; Latham-Koenig Christina.</p>
<p class="content">Read the text and match the questions with the answers from an interview of two young women about their relationship with food. Then, read the interviews again and answer the questions in exercise 1c. Next, match words and phrases from the text with the definitions given in exercise 1d. These self-study tasks are essential to language practice, but they will not be sent.</p>
<p class="content">Complete the activity by studying the vocabulary  provided in <a class="icon" href="u1/recursos/food_and_restaurants_u1t3.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="icon libro"></span></a><strong>Food and restaurants</strong> and posting a message in the <strong>Forum <span class="icon foro"></span>Food and eating</strong> in which you express agreement or disagreement about the following sentences:</p>

  <li>Vegetarians are healthier than people who eat a lot of meat.</li>
  <li>You can often eat better in cheap restaurants than in expensive ones.</li>
  <li>Every country thinks that their cooking if the best.</li>
</ol>
<p class="content">Be sure of using appropriate grammar, vocabulary and spelling in your message. Also, think about examples you can use to support your point of view.
