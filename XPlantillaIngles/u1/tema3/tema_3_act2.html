    <strong>Rumiko</strong> and answer the questions in exercise 2b. When you listen to the first time you should try not to write anything  but just try to get a general understanding of what Rumiko says and to decide if food is ‘fuel or pleasure’ for her. Then, focus on the questions and take notes of the answers. Next, pay close attention to exercise 2c in which you have to choose the correct tense form.</p>
    <p class="content">To check your answers revise  <strong>Present simple and continuous, action and non-action verbs</strong> This will help you to revise the two tenses of present and distinguish between action and non-action verbs, which are sometimes called stative and dynamic verbs.</p>
    <p class="content">All of these are considered self-study tasks essential to language practice, but they will not be sent.</p>
