		<p class="content">It is what we do every day and how we live our life what describes us. Personal information, likes, dislikes and interest are often topics that interest almost everyone who tries to know more about us. Just as well, the world surrounding us offers good opportunities for interactions with others. These two communicative purposes require structures of Present simple tense and Present continuous tense, vocabulary and expressions.</p>
      <p class="content">The purpose of the whole unit is to provide students with enough opportunities to activate previous knowledge of English, to revise and learn grammar aspects of the language that are used to express actions, events, routines that take place at the present time, as well as personal information and opinions. Grammar resources have been designed in such a way as to provide students with a clear presentation, guided and free practice, while production tasks need the mastering of key structures. Students will develop listening skills through realistic tasks which reinforce the mastering of the language. </p>
      <p class="content">The vocabulary in this unit is presented in a meaningful context, using interesting reading texts, and it is practiced and extended throughout the unit. The whole unit aims at providing the students with opportunities to practice the language and expand their knowledge of it. There are also reading texts related to the main grammar focus of the unit. Students are invited to explore and get familiar with new vocabulary through a variety of activities too. The activities to be carried out will also be diverse. They go from simple self-study tasks involving reading, writing, and listening practice, to tasks in which you demonstrate your understanding of materials and learning.</p>
