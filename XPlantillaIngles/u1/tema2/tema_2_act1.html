   <p class="content">Have you ever been to an art museum? Have you tried to describe a famous painting?</p>
   <p class="content">A famous painting provides the context for revising the present continuous (for things happening now) and prepositions of place in this activity.</p>
   <p class="content">Open the file <a class="icon" href="u1/recursos/moulinrouge_u1t2.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="icon libro"></span></a><strong>At the Moulin Rouge</strong> from Oxeden, Clive, &amp; Latham-Koenig Christina; which includes a picture of the famous painter by Toulouse-Lautrec. Look at the painting and answer the six questions from the Grammar 3a section. Then, identify the correct form of the verb in Grammar 3b section. These activities are necessary as language practice, but they will not be sent.</p>
   <p class="content">To check your answers, revise the <b>Present Continuous </b>resource<b>.</b> It will help you to understand the form and use of this tense.  This language referent will be useful as you move through the chart and rules  concerning the <i>Present continuous </i>to  describe actions which are in progress <i>now</i>,  at the moment of speaking. This tense is also used to describe what is  happening in a painting as if we were looking at a scene through the window.</p>
