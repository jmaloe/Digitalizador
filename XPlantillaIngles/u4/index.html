       <p class="content">The topic of this unit is about cities and lifestyle. It aims at providing you with language exposure and language practice that will help you to make comparisons about cities and places, in addition to express most outstanding qualities from a place. The materials included in this unit will make reference to <em>Comparatives</em> and <em>Superlatives</em>. It will also address <em>quantifiers</em> and <em>phrasal verbs</em> in English.</p>
       <p class="content">The activities you will be required to carry out will also be diverse. They go from simple self-study exercises to audio recording of your own information. Special attention will also be drawn to grammatical tenses and forms: <em>Present Perfect</em> vs. <em>Simple Past tense</em>. Besides, vocabulary will be dealt with as you move though the reading texts and audio materials. </p>
       <p class="content">The purpose of the whole unit is to provide students with enough opportunities to activate previous knowledge of English, to revise and learn grammar aspects of the language that are used to refer to present and past. Grammar resources have been designed in such a way as to provide students with a clear presentation, guided and free practice, while production tasks need the mastering of key structures. Students will develop listening skills through realistic tasks which reinforce the mastering of the language.   </p>
