  <p class="content">Are we living too fast? Modern life has brought a lot of changes with it.  Todayâ€™s diet, habits and entertainment are diverse, but they sometimes have more negative effects rather than positive. For instance, with less time to have proper meals, people have frozen or fast food. People also complain about not having enough time for family and relaxation and having too many things to do in a day.</p>

You will also read an adapted article from a magazine and write a text about the effects of modern life. The activities in this unit have been designed for the sole purpose of giving you enough practice on grammar, reading and writing mainly.
